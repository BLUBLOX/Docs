BLUBLOX
Biometric Ledger Utility BLOX

Bluepaper Version 0.2 (Working Draft) Subject to Change
Overview
In the near future, people will use biometrics in almost every part of their daily lives. From payments to identification, biometrics provides a convenient way to quickly process all types of sensitive data safely and securely. This technology, combined with the growing advantages of the block-chain, can provide a major leap in security, privacy, and convenience never possible before.
Today, Biometric recognition can be found in many places, including smartphones, ATM machines, and high security areas. These technologies are helpful, but does not provide the seamless, everyday experience we’ve all been waiting for. BLUBLOX (Biometric Ledger Utility Blocks) seeks to realize the true potential of a biometric future by creating the world’s first decentralized and anonymous peer-to-peer identification platform. Powered only by a public network of, “identity miners”, BLUBLOX will become the first foundation for endless digital programs to be built upon.
“One Identity, Many Applications”
People can use their hand to login into any BLUBLOX terminal, without sharing data between other merchants (unless desired). All types of digital assets can be stored in the users’ biometric wallet and exclusively accessed by the corresponding owners hand pattern. These assets can be created with conditional rules, such as allocated time or payment based variables.
BLUBLOX will not only develop the blockchain software platform, but has designed the proper combination of necessary biometric hardware as well. The founding members believe it is crucial to provide a hardware based platform at this stage in order to successfully launch this technology into mainstream markets. Everyday tasks like paying for a product or service, possessing tickets to a movie or event, registering at a medical office, claiming rewards, or even entering your own house easier and more secure.
BLUBLOX will work closely with the community, businesses, and governments, to help transform identification into a blockchain secured service, owned and operated by the public interest. 




Q1. WHY THE NAME BLUBLOX? 
BLU is an acronym for Biometric Ledger Utilization. BLOXS is a play on the word, “block”, which refers to a “Blockchain”, the underlying technology that BLUBLOX uses.

Q2. WHAT IS THE BLUBLOX TOKEN? 
The BLUBLOX token is needed to run applications and process transactions on the BLUBLOX platform. It will be used to transfer value within the network and is our official store of value. BLUBLOX tokens are used for paying processing fees and can be stored in a user’s wallet. Every token is fungible and has no unique characteristics making it impossible to track.

Q3. HOW DOES BLUBLOX WORK? 
BLUBLOX utilizes three fundamental technologies for its platform: blockchain technology, biometric technology, and dynamically distributed networks (DDN’s). Together, these technologies will produce a decentralized, decensored, and trustless system that can be used for time sensitive transactions like payments or entry access. This would be the first system to provide a publicly controlled network of their identification without relying on a centralized authority. The BLUBLOX white paper will go over these technologies in detail.  

Q4. HOW DOES BLUBLOX KEEP A USERS INFORMATION PRIVATE? 
As strong privacy advocates ourselves, the BLUBLOX founders take privacy very seriously and we realize how careful we must be with a biometric system of this scale. That’s why the BLUBLOX system does not store any data about your actual identity. Every biometric scan converts your recognizable biometric information into a non-recognizable token at an encrypted hardware level, with no real difference between one token or another. The only way a user could be verified is if they are physically present at the time of scanning. Even then, no biometric information is ever shared and all other transactions or applications cannot be retrieved or linked from other transactions on the network. Any digital information linked to your token is kept within customized applications and not on the BLUBLOXS platform. 

In addition, much like the Monero network, all transactions remain traceless and private to everyone but the participants of the transaction (by default). Applications do not share information which each other, only a wallet identifier. Each application can attach its own unique identifier to the individuals’ wallet once they have the corresponding token. 

For example, Sally’s favorite coffee shop is using an application that stores rewards points and payment methods on BLUBLOX. Since sally is enrolled with BLUBLOX at other locations she can instantly purchase her breakfast using Bitcoin and also receives a discount for redeeming her reward points. Sally remembers she has a doctor’s appointment and uses her doctors BLUBLOX application to make checking in easier. When sally arrives she confirms her identity and insurance information. This information is retrieved from the doctor’s local computers which can only be accessed using her hand. 
No information is exchanged between the coffee shop and her doctor’s office although sally can easily see all of these events and transactions on her account.

Q5. HOW DOES YOUR BIOMETRIC DEVICE WORK? 
The BLUBLOX reader is a small communication device that scans a person’s hand with harmless infrared light. This invisible light is used to identify the unique blood flow pattern of that individual. This biometric information is instantly converted into a long series of characters that can be used on the network. This number specifically represents only that user and can then be used as a key to unlock their digital wallet(s) within the BLUBLOX network. These wallets can contain other tokenized information stored by any number of applications, to be accessed for later use.

Q6.HOW FAST IS THE TRANSACTION SPEED?
Transaction speeds will depend on network strength and is supported by the BLUBLOX devices themselves. As more devices join the network so will the processing power of the BLUBLOX platform. One important design feature of BLUBLOX is to implement a dynamic self-adjusting network that analyzes network traffic and connects to nodes that are close by with the lowest load and latency.  

Q7. WHAT DOES THE BLUBLOX WALLET STORE? 
By default, the BLUBLOX wallet can store BLUBLOX tokens, Bitcoin(Value), Ethereum(Contracts), and Monero/ZCash(Privacy). Custom user applications can be made to accept virtually any token or form of payment on the BLUBLOX platform. 

Q8. WHAT OTHER INFORMATION CAN BE STORED ON THE BLUBLOX TOKEN? The BLUBLOX tokens are used as a form of payment to process requests on the network. No information is stored on the token. All information is stored on the individuals BLUBLOX wallet which is created at the time of sign up or by downloading the smartphone app.

Q9. IS THERE MINING ON THE BLUBLOX NETWORK? IF SO, HOW DOES IT FUNCTION? IF NOT WHY? BLUBLOX will enable token holders to help mine transactions on the network through a proof of stake rewards system. As long as your account holds at least one BLUBLOX token, you can mine. The more tokens a miner has in their wallet, the greater chances they have to process transactions on the network and thus mine new tokens.

Q10. WHAT IS THE REWARD/INCENTIVATIONS TO MINE? 
BLUBLOX miners will be incentivized to mine BLUBLOX transactions by creating new coins into the network. Ultimately, 25% of all BLUBLOX tokens (404,508,497) will be mined by the end of a 7-year period, thus capping out the networks total supply.

Q11. WHAT FUNTIONS WOULD THIS PLATFORM CARRY OUT? 
The main features of the BLUBLOX platform will work as an identity verification platform, built to support many time critical applications like contracts, physical access, voting, tickets, property entry, and payments.

Q12. WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM TOTAL SUPPLY? 
The final supply will be 1,618,033,988 BLUBLOX tokens. 25% of these tokens will be mined during the next 7 years.
Q13. HOW MUCH IS THE TOKEN? 
Like with all crypto tokens, the tokens price depends on the overall value of the network. The more the network grows and becomes more useful, the higher value will BLUBLOX token demand in the marketplace. 

Q14. WILL BLUBLOX BE RELEASED ON AN EXCHANGE?  
We believe that publicly trading the BLUBLOX token on an exchange will be good for the cryptocurrency ecosystem and promote its services and plans to do so once the network has been tested and running.

Q15. WHEN IS THE ICO? 
The BLUBLOX Initial Coin Offering (ICO) token sale is set to launch in MAY 2018. The token sale will last 30 days with a max cap of 40M USD. 

Q16. HOW MANY COINS WILL BE SOLD? COST?
40% of the total supply of coins will be sold during the 30-day ICO. A quarter of BLUBLOX coins will be retained for operating and expansion costs. A quarter of all total supply tokens will need to be mined over the next 7 years. These tokens would be randomly distributed with a probability ranking based on proof of stake. 10% of all coins are held by the founders.

Cost of each coin: 40M USD / 647,213,595 Tokens = 0.0618033 ~ .06 cents(USD) per token
The First 6 days of the BLUBLOX ICO pays out additional bonus tokens: 

ICO Day 1	+20% Bonus BLUBOX
ICO Day 2	+18% Bonus BLUBOX
ICO Day 3	+16% Bonus BLUBOX
ICO Day 4	+14% Bonus BLUBOX
ICO Day 5	+12% Bonus BLUBOX
ICO Day 6	+10% Bonus BLUBOX









Q17. HOW ARE YOUR TOKENS DISTRUBIED?
BLUBLOX ICO tokens will be distributed into ERC20 tokens and sent back to the specified wallet address. These tokens will convert into a 1:1 BLUBLOX token ratio after the ICO.

Q18. WHAT CURRENCIES DO YOU ACCEPT DURING THE TOKEN SALE?
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ethereum Classic will be accepted during the token sale. We do not accept USD or other fiat currencies.

Q19. WILL THE TOKEN SALE BE RESTRICTED IN ANY COUNTRY?
Residents of The United States, North Korea, and Syria, are prohibited from participating in the BLUBLOX token sale.



20. WHAT IS YOUR ROADMAP?
 

Q21. HOW WILL THE BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGY WORK? 
BLUBLOX hardware device reads the unique biometric pattern of a person’s hand and converts it into an encrypted token which can be recognized anonymously across any BLUBLOX device. This type of biometric scanning is nearly impossible to copy or replicate and provides the user with a special key that can only be accessed by having the physical hand of the user present.

Q22. HOW DO I KNOW THE BIOMETRIC DEVICE IS SECURE? 
BLUBLOX relies on the same secure network technologies that operate very similar to Bitcoin, giving users control over their own keys and therefore, their identities. A user’s biometric vein pattern is never recorded, only the token that represents it.

Q23. WHO ARE THE FOUNDING MEMBERS? 
The core founding members consists of just two individuals with extensive technical and management backgrounds. Additional founding members will be recruited as needed.

Q24. HOW MUCH WILL THE DEVICE RETAIL FOR? 
The estimated retail cost of the BLUBLOX biometric scanner for business users will be 200.00(USD). Because these devices are also part of the mining network, they should produce a small return for the owner of the devices by processing transactions on the network.

Q25. WHAT FEATURES DOES THE BLUBLOX DEVICE HAVE?
In addition to having biometric reading capabilities, the BLUBLOX device will also be able to communicate with many different devices in order to support future applications. Version 1 units will include: LAN Port, 4 USB Ports, Bluetooth/Low-Energy Bluetooth, Dual band Wi-Fi, Near Frequency Communication (NFC), and RFID (Remote Frequency Identification). The unit will also feature an IPS LCD touch screen, and Magnetic strip/EMV chip reader.

Q26. WILL ORGANISATIONAL PROFIT BE SHARED WITH THE TOKEN HOLDERS? 
All profit, returns, dividends, and revenue that is not used for business expenses will be used to buy back BLUBLOX tokens. Any tokens BLUBLOX reclaims will be held as an asset.

Q27. HOW WILL THE UNDERLYING SOFTWARE WORK? 
Please refer to the official whitepaper for technical details.

Q28. I HAVE TWO HANDS, DOES THAT MEAN I CAN HAVE TWO ACCOUNTS?
Yes. Each hand may assume its own individual identity. BLUBLOX recommends using one for personal and private locations and the other for leisure/other.
Q30. IS MY BIOMETRIC IDENITY SAFE ON THE BLOCKCHAIN? 
Defining information is not kept about an individual on the BLUBLOX network. So even in the rare event a malicious party were to gain access to your wallet identifier they could not link the account to you. Only at the time of your interaction with the BLUBLOX device will allow wallet access.
 
Q31. WILL THERE BE A WALLET APP FOR SMARTPHONES? 
Yes, BLUBLOX will release an iPhone/android wallet application after the ICO. The wallet will feature an identity management, two factor authorizations and can hold BLUBLOX, Bitcoin and Ethereum, by default.

Q32. WILL THERE BE A UI FOR MY ACCOUNT?
The user interface will be combined within the smartphone wallet application. Miners will have a graphical user interface (GUI) within Windows and Linux operating systems.

Q33. WHAT CRYPTOCURRENCIES CAN BE ACCEPTED ON THIS PLATFORM? 
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a decision between Monero or Zcash will be supported by default. But technically any currency or token could be supported using the BLUBLOX API.

Q34. WHY DO YOU ONLY SUPPORT BITCOIN, ETHEREUM, AND MONERO/Zcash NATIVELY? 
The BLUBLOX team are strong advocates of BITCOIN and therefore wish to support the Bitcoin ecosystem. Ethereum is supported due to its high availability and can store contracts. Monero or Zcash will be used to protect the user more concerned about privacy. Other crypto currency can be added by a using the BLUBLOX platform.

Q34. CAN YOU PAY VENDORS WITH YOUR HAND?
Yes, you can, the BLUBLOX system will be able to transfer any supported crypto value into local fiat currency and deposited into a merchant’s accounts without designing any additional applications.
 
Q35. WHAT IS YOUR STANCE ON PRIVACY? 
BLUBLOX is unable to identify any of its users and cannot retrieve any information about a user’s account. The BLUBLOX founders and development teams do not have the ability to unlock a user wallet even if forced to do so. Keys are randomly generated and can only be found using a person’s physical hand. The BLUBLOX organization seeks to base its headquarters in privacy positive environments with minimal governmental interference. This reflects the vision of the founding team to create a fully trustless platform.
 
Q34. WHERE ARE YOUR HEADQUARTERS LOCATED? 
For now, the BLUBLOX team is multinational and working from different locations across the globe, but we are planning to base our main headquarters in Singapore.

Q35. WHAT IS YOUR COMPANY PHILOSOPHY?
We believe that technology is a natural progression of human beings to work towards improving the quality of their life. Recently, these advancements have been truly outstanding and quickly moving into fields of artificial intelligence and virtual/augmented reality. While this is an exciting time to be alive and enjoy these advancements, it is also important to realize that we must work together in order to not allow these powerful technologies to turn into powerful systems of control. As history repeatedly shows, powerful tools can get into the wrong hands and get out of control, reversing their intended purpose of improving humanity as a whole. BLUBLOX will uphold people’s right to freedom by allowing these principals to guide everything we do. 

Q36. WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS THE BLUBLOX PLATFORM WRITTEN IN? 
BLUBLOX language will be finalized after the founding developers are consulted and a common census is made. Current defaults are C+ and Python. 

Q37. WILL THERE BE AN API? 
Yes, there will be an API for businesses or individuals to use, to help build their own applications on the BLUBLOX platform. 

Q38. WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES DOES THE BLUBLOX API SUPPORT? 
To start JavaScript and Python will be supported on the BLUBLOX device.

Q39. WHEN WILL THE NETWORK BE READY TO USE? 
Open testing begins in October of 2018, with a full network launch in November 2018. 

Q40. WHEN WILL THE PRODUCT BE LAUNCHED? 
Currently, estimated product launch date will fall between September - October of 2018. Please see road map for reference.
 

Q41. ARE THERE ANY INVESTMENTS IN BLUBLOX.IO TO DATE?  
No, BLUBLOX has never taken any institutional investments. 

Q42. WILL TOKEN HOLDERS HAVE VOTING RIGHTS WITHIN THE COMPANY? 
Yes, a proof of stake voting system split into 3 groups: 
Verified Merchants with BLUBLOX Devices, Token Holders, and current BLUBLOX employees. 
(The BLUBLOX wallets will be used to vote and assigns a wallet identifier to confirm the vote. These voting codes are validated on a once per identity or BLUBLOX device basis.) 

Q43. WHAT IS MERCHANT CONVERSION? 
This feature gives merchants the ability to convert crypto currency in real time to fiat currency bank accounts so vendors are not subjected to market fluctuations. This service will be available in the first quarter of 2019.


Q44. WHY WILL THE BIOMETRIC DEVICES MINE ON THE NETWORK? 
Users of the BLUBLOX network will be able to reduce transaction fees by helping mine each other’s transactions. These machines will mine local transactions using a dynamically adjusting network that works with other local devices to confirm transactions on the network, thus decentralizing and improving network performance in turn will be used for transaction tokens to access the BLUBLOX network. This feature will also help support the network by lowering processing times. 

Q45. HOW MUCH ARE THE TRANSACTIONS FEES?
Merchants current cost is 3 BLUBLOX per transaction, this rate will be adjusted depending on cost. 
Any changes to this rate will be left up to network wide votes.

Q46. WILL BLUBLOX DEVICES COMPETE WITH MINERS?
Miners that download the desktop software and process transactions on the network are the only group capable of mining new coins. The BLUBLOX biometric devices help reduce fees and transaction confirmation times between local nodes. Ultimately, it is the miners who will upload and settle transactions to the blockchain.
